# Install Palette in your chatbot

These bundles contain the clean Palette SDK source and client integration. They
do not contain preinstalled Julia, Rust, Python, extra kernels, credentials, or
a hosted service. Initial preparation takes several minutes; do it once before
connecting. This is a source-based installation, not a thirty-second binary installer.

## 1. Prepare your runtime

Use Linux with Julia 1.12, Python 3, Rust/Cargo, and bubblewrap installed.
On Windows, use a WSL2 Linux distribution with those prerequisites; execute this
step in that distribution. Native macOS and native Windows supervised runtimes
are not currently supported. Cloud-only clients can connect to a Linux host.

Download one client archive. Upload `Palette-ChatGPT.zip` through ChatGPT Plugins
**+**, or `Palette-Claude.zip` through Claude Customize > Plugins > Upload.
Each contains exactly one plugin, its runtime source and this setup guide.
For runtime preparation, extract that same download to a permanent location.
ChatGPT has a single `palette/` folder; Claude's files are at the archive root.
Claude Desktop's separate Extensions installer uses `Palette-Claude.mcpb`,
which also includes its runtime source; it is not a second required download.
The `.mcpb` is itself ZIP format: extract a copy and run setup from its root.
From the directory containing `setup.py`, run:

```sh
python3 setup.py \
  --output-dir "$HOME/.local/share/palette-client" \
  --data-dir "$HOME/.local/share/palette-data" \
  --depot-dir "$HOME/.local/share/palette-depot"
```

For Windows Claude Desktop add `--wsl-distribution YOUR_DISTRO_NAME` (the name
shown by `wsl.exe --list --quiet`). Keep output, data and depot outside `sdk/`.
The helper instantiates the Julia project, builds the locked Rust host, prewarms
the real sandbox, and generates `palette-launch.json`, `generic-mcp.json`, a
local portable plugin, and a `palette-mcp` stdio command. It never requests model
API calls or automatically configures a tunnel. Linux must permit bubblewrap's
user namespaces; an AppArmor denial is an administrator setup issue, not a
reason to disable isolation. See `sdk/runtime/docs/install.md`.

For an existing, already built and prewarmed installation, use
`--repo-dir /absolute/path/to/Palette --connect-only` with its existing depot.
This option checks required files but intentionally does not rebuild or prewarm.

## 2a. Claude

Upload **Palette-Claude.zip** through Customize > Plugins > Upload. Its
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest, setup skill and `.mcp.json` are at the
plugin root. Prepare the runtime from the same ZIP as described above.
Local clients need the generated `palette-mcp` executable on PATH, or the
absolute command from `generic-mcp.json`. Cloud Claude needs a supported remote
MCP connection to your Linux host; the upload does not host the runtime.

For Claude Desktop's **Extensions** installer, instead download and install
**Palette-Claude.mcpb**. Prepare its included source and select the generated
`palette-launch.json` when prompted. On Windows use `--wsl-distribution` during
setup and make the configuration accessible to the Windows app. This Node
bridge forwards MCP stdio to the selected Linux/WSL2 runtime.

These are alternative client formats. Neither ZIP contains a nested extension
that must be separately downloaded or uploaded.

## 2b. ChatGPT Chat

Extract `Palette-ChatGPT.zip` and prepare the runtime above. ChatGPT's cloud Chat
mode cannot execute a local `palette-mcp` command merely because you upload a ZIP.

1. Connect the generated `palette-mcp` executable to **your own** Secure MCP Tunnel
   using OpenAI's tunnel client instructions. Keep the client running on the
   prepared Linux machine. Use the exact absolute path printed by setup.py.
   Alternatively deploy a supported authenticated HTTPS MCP endpoint.
2. In ChatGPT, enable developer mode when available under your account policy.
3. Open Plugins, add a connection named Palette, choose Tunnel, and select your
   tunnel ID; or enter your hosted MCP URL. Review the discovered tools.
4. Start a new Chat conversation and select that connection.

No tunnel ID or API credential is included. Tunnel registration/authentication
is separate from your ChatGPT subscription and from Palette runtime setup.
Follow the current official instructions rather than guessing account permissions:

- https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/secure-mcp-tunnels
- https://developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/connect-chatgpt

Upload the original `Palette-ChatGPT.zip` through Plugins **+**. It contains
one `palette/` plugin folder, including the SDK and setup instructions, with no
nested plugin declarations. The package has `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` at its
plugin root for Agent Plugins-compatible
local clients. That template expects `palette-mcp` on PATH. Prefer importing the
**generated** `palette-local-plugin` directory, whose configuration has absolute
paths. Directory submission for public ChatGPT distribution requires the remote
endpoint/registration/review workflow; this archive is not an approved directory
listing and contains no fabricated app ID. Do not create duplicate registrations
when only the installed runtime changes.

## 3. Verify persistence and isolation

Ask the model to create a new thread-scoped workspace and use its returned
workspace ID explicitly. Evaluate `probe = 41`, then evaluate `probe + 1` in a
second call: expect 42. Start a separate workspace and check that `probe` is not
defined there. Caller-chosen context keys are routing hints, not authentication.

Provide `BRAIN_BLAST.md` as optional model context, or withhold it for unprimed
exploration. Use public supported API contracts; extra lab toolchains are absent.
Host write roots stay closed until the administrator configures them and the
broker receives exact-operation approval. A client without confirmation support
cannot grant that approval simply by evaluating Julia.

## Updates and license

Keep the SDK at a stable path and retain the external data/depot directories.
Setup preserves an existing generated plugin manifest; use a fresh output
directory to adopt updated listing metadata without overwriting local edits.
Stop the adapter, replace the SDK with the new source bundle, rebuild/prewarm,
restart, and refresh client tool discovery if schemas changed. Do not copy an
old Manifest blindly into a new source release. Keep a prior source bundle for
rollback; do not overwrite live runtime files during an active call.

Core is AGPL-3.0-only; these client packages/installers and identified public
docs are Apache-2.0. Inherited MIT grants/notices remain intact. The included
`sdk/runtime/licenses/README.md` gives the exact source boundaries. SHA256SUMS.txt
accompanies the artifacts; SOURCE.json records the precise source revision and
the repository-only authoring manifests omitted from the embedded SDK. Their
portable template is retained under `templates/` and installed outside the SDK.
