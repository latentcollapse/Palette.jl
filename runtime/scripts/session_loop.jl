Palette persistent session loop -- runs inside the sandboxed worker, kept
alive across many turns instead of one `-e script` per launch.

Protocol: newline-delimited JSON on stdin/stdout, one request per line, one
response per line, in order. The first thing printed is a HELLO line
carrying this process's own `epoch` -- a fresh UUID generated here, inside
this process, not handed in by the orchestrator -- so a caller holding a
handle from a previous process (this one crashed and got relaunched) gets
a real, unambiguous mismatch instead of silently talking to a different
Julia world that happens to share a session_id. See
`runtime/security/session.py`'s `NeuraSession` for the orchestrator side and why
this mirrors (not copies) NeuraBash's own `RUNTIME_EPOCH` lesson
(`Project-LIRA-NeuraBash/julia/bin/daemon.jl`).

Request:  {"request_id": "...", "kind": "EXECUTE" | "EPHEMERAL", "code": "...", "ceiling": {...}?,
           "payload": "..."?, "timeout_s": number?}
Response: {"request_id": "...", "epoch": "...", "success": bool, "data": ..., "display": ..., "output": ...,
           "error": ..., "interrupted": true?, "kernel_exit": true?}
HELLO:    {"kind": "HELLO", "epoch": "..."}

`payload` is bound as `PAYLOAD` for that one EXECUTE turn. At `timeout_s` a
turn still waiting is interrupted (`interrupted`) and the kernel keeps its
state; one that ignores the interrupt for INTERRUPT_GRACE_S ends the process
right after its reply (`kernel_exit`).

`kind == "EXECUTE"` evaluates into this session's own persistent
`eval_module` -- the durable "mind": real state, real bindings, real
compiled methods, kept for the life of this process.

`kind == "EPHEMERAL"` does NOT run in this process at all. An earlier
version of this file ran ephemeral code in a fresh, throwaway `Module`
in-process (see `Neura.EphemeralTool`/`check_ephemeral_source!`, which
still exist and are still real, tested, and honestly documented as a
namespace-HYGIENE measure). That was proven, by direct adversarial
testing, not sufficient as an authority boundary: `Core.eval(Base,
:(function show(io::IO, x::Int) ... end))` -- a value only assembled at
RUNTIME -- extends a foreign module's method table with zero syntactic
trace in the submitted source for any parse-time check to see. No static
checker can fully police a language with reflective `eval`, and
crippling `eval` itself would violate Palette's own "unbounded power
inside the sandbox" thesis. The fix is not a smarter checker; it's
putting the boundary underneath the language instead of inside it:
`EPHEMERAL` spawns a real, disposable, OS-sandboxed CHILD process via the
already-adversarially-proven `spawn_child_worker` capability (see
`runtime/security/broker.py`, `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` rows 16-19). If the child's
code corrupts its own `Base.show`, that corruption dies with the child
process -- Linux throws the whole thing away, which is a fundamentally
stronger guarantee than trying to detect or reverse the corruption
afterward. `Neura.request_capability("spawn_child_worker", ...)` already
enforces `C_child ⊆ C_caller`; an ephemeral turn's optional `"ceiling"`
field (default `{}`, i.e. full language power, zero broker-mediated
authority) is validated against THIS session's own ceiling exactly like
any other spawn_child_worker request.

# that a script run under a project whose Project.toml lists only `Neura`
# (not JSON/UUIDs directly) cannot `using JSON` itself even though Neura
# depends on it internally: a package's dependencies aren't visible by
# name to code outside that package just because the package is loadable.
# `Neura.JSON`/`Neura.UUIDs` work because `using JSON` inside Neura.jl's
