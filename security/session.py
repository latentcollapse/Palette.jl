"""
NeuraJL persistent session -- "persistent mind, disposable machinery".

The rest of this codebase (launch_worker.py, broker.py) launches one
`julia -e script` process per call: real state persistence only within
that one process's lifetime. This module keeps ONE sandboxed worker alive
across many turns instead, running scripts/session_loop.jl, while reusing
every existing authority primitive unchanged: the same bwrap argv builder,
the same broker/ceiling model, the same depot-clone mechanism (now
session-lifetime, via create_session_depot, instead of one-shot).

Session identity is explicit, not assumed. `NeuraSession.epoch` is read
from the worker process's own first line of output (a fresh UUID it
generates itself on startup -- see session_loop.jl) -- never guessed,
never carried over from a previous process. If the worker process dies,
its epoch dies with it: `NeuraSession` does not silently relaunch or
reconnect. A caller holding a dead session's handle gets `SessionDeadError`
and has to decide what that means, the same way NeuraBash's daemon rejects
a session handle from a previous `RUNTIME_EPOCH` (see
`Project-LIRA-NeuraBash/julia/bin/daemon.jl`) rather than pretending
process death didn't happen -- the lesson reused here, not the
implementation (NeuraBash's is a multi-client daemon serving many logical
sessions from one long-lived process with its own binary framed protocol;
this is one dedicated sandboxed worker per session, newline-delimited JSON
over its own stdio, no daemon, no multiplexing).

The authority model is completely unchanged by persistence: the broker
still only sees Class-C requests over its own socket, exactly as for a
one-shot worker. Nothing about keeping the worker warm grants it anything
it didn't already have.
