    stress(cmd; n = 200, jobs = 8, seconds = 45) -> StressReport

Run the shell command `cmd` (a String, run by bash) `n` times, `jobs` at a
time, and report how often each exit code came back, and the first failing
run's index and output. Run `i` sees `STRESS_RUN=i`, so `STRESS_RUN=17 cmd`
repeats it. Stops early after `seconds`, so a call stays within its limit,
and says how many runs it made.
